1. Problem Statement : Analyze customer satisfaction after intervention (aralashish ,tasir)

2. Data Collection : Data collected from Kaggle.
    Independent features : Group, Customer_Segment, Sales_Before, Sales_After, Customer_Satisfaction_Before, Customer_Satisfaction_After
    Target variable : Purchase_Made - Indicates whether a purchase was made after the intervention.

3. Data cleaning : In first section Data cleaned with Datacleaner library.
                   In second section Object type missing value filled by mode() and numerical types filled by mean()

4. Algorithm selection : Our target variable is fits Classification so we chose Decision Tree Classifier model to train and test our dataset.

5. Data preprocessing: 
            first section: Used Datacleaner lib to transform object type features to numerical.
            second section: 
                    Used Label Encoder to transform object type features to numerical
                    To reach good model performance used Standart Scaling

6. Experiment set-up : by using train_test_split target feature va independent features train va test qismiga ajratildi.

7. Model evaluation: 
            x_train,y_train orqali model ga fit qilindi. by using x_test   predicted_y topildi. 
            model performance ni aniqlash uchun accuracy score topildi.

8. Conclusion : By using Datacleaner lib  we got  little good accuracy score but it's not mean our model is best.
