    Target variable : MSRP - Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price

3. Data cleaning : Found  missing values numerical and classified category, not found dublicates, string type values.
                   Object type missing value filled by mode() and numerical types filled by mean()

4. Algorithm selection : Our target variable is fits Regression so we chose Decision Tree Regression model to train our dataset.

5. Data preprocessing: 
    Used Label Encoder to transform object type features to numerical
    To reach good model performance used Standart Scaling

6. Experiment set-up : by using train_test_split target feature va independent features train va test qismiga ajratildi.

7. Model evaluation: 
    x_train,y_train orqali model ga fit qilindi. by using x_test   predicted_y topildi. 
    model performance ni aniqlash uchun mean squared error va R2 scorelar topildi.

    model performance ni oshirish uchun we did GridSearchCV hyperparameter tuning.
    after tuning found predicted_y with best parameters. with GridSearchCV tuned model found MSE and R2 score



8. Conclusion : There is no clear difference in metrics before and after tuning
